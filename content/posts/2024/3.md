#### Advent of Code 2023 (I know i'm a year late)
I've a quite a bit of interest of actually improving my coding skills... so i think this is finally me doing some whiteboard question, using go!  
I know this is going to be painful but i guess it's a sacrifice that i have to make, anyway see you in the future (i.e. i dont know).

Here's the repository of my desperate attempt on solving these puzzle :
